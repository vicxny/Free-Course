:calendar_spiral: Homework Due Tuesday (May 11th):
Please,
Finish: TEAM PROJECT
Finish: HITLIST
Please research the following methods:
map
reduce
filter
forEach
sort
slice
pop
shift
push
unshift
includes
indexOf
every

Give a short description of what the method does, how it works, it's time complexity (if appropriate), and give three examples of it in action!

Questions to practice:

One:
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the result of multiplying the values together in order. Example:
[1, 2, 3, 4] => 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24

Two:
You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order. The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed 'age' of 0. Return a new array with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between the youngest and oldest age].

Three:
Sum all the numbers of the array except the highest and the lowest element (the value, not the index!).
Example:
[ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 ] => 16
[ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 ] => 6

5 codewars tagged as arrays (minimum)

Add what you learn to an interview deck on Anki!

Please take the time to work on your 100 Hours Project, Hitlist, and working through the methods I shared above!  I can't stress how important it is to put the time into researching these methods and Knowing Them WELL! 

Homework Due Tuesday (May 18th):
Review your methods and the questions assigned last week. :point_right_tone4: ANKI ALERT :rotating_light:
