Please take the time to work on your 100 Hours Project, Hitlist, and working through the methods I shared above!  I can't stress how important it is to put the time into researching these methods and Knowing Them WELL! 

Homework Due Tuesday (May 18th):
Review your methods and the questions assigned last week. :point_right_tone4: ANKI ALERT :rotating_light: 
Start React:
Read - https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70 (old, weird, just get through it)
Watch  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8 (2 hours - just get through it)
Do - https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react (2-3 hours - just get through it)
Also, if able, please get some movement in as the next month or two will require a lot of hunkered down coding time! I've been enjoying this mobility routine:  https://youtu.be/SsT_go-oCcQ
